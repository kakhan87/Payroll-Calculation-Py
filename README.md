<h1>Application Overview & Specifications</h1>

The intent of this application is to prepare a Pay Slip to be included in a cheque envelope for the employees of a small business. The Pay Slip will also be used by the accountant to prepare the actual pay-cheques, and to record the deductions in a company ledger. No paper output is required from this application.

The application will prompt the user for <br>
• the employee name (the name to appear on the slip),<br>
• the number of hours actually worked by the employee over the week,<br>
• their hourly rate of pay,<br>
• whether the employee should have deductions removed from their gross pay (yes or no), and<br>
• if (and only if) deductions are to be removed, the percentage of their gross pay that is to be deducted in the calculation of net pay.<br>

Once the application has collected the above information from the user, it will calculate the employee's<br>
• Gross Pay<br>
o Gross Pay is calculated as regular pay plus overtime pay.<br>
    􀂃 Regular pay is calculated by hours worked, to a maximum of 40 hours, times the hourly rate of pay<br>
    􀂃 Overtime pay is hours worked beyond 40 hours, times 1.5, and then times the hourly rate (i.e. overtime is paid out at time and a half)<br>
• Dollar Amount of Deductions<br>
• Net Pay<br>
